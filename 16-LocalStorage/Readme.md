**Local storage and event delation**
using a concept of event delegation on ul(considering responsible element who stays everytime on page whenever we click on the input checkbox inside li)

here click was done on li -> input but as it is dynamic so we use ul to handle the listening task on li.

local storage - getItem(), setItem() methods.
